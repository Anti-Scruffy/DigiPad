The main aim to design this project was to provide the user an easy and interactive way of reading and writing stories. With the advent of computers as a substitute or rather a replacement for humans, the immersive experience manually maintaining complex processes is simplified.
Only those users who have provided authenticate details are allowed either to register as a user or to process further. Effective management is always a key factor in any form of business. Digipad is no exception. A great deal of technological advancements has led the way to efficient management.
As a consequence of the emergence of newer products, new entities and attributes may have to be incorporated. Our application offers a solution to real life situations to an appreciable extent.

The project “DIGIPAD” is developed to provide a web application for an Immersive story Writing and Reading experience. There are normal story telling platforms but most of them don’t emphasis on interactive story telling. So the above mentioned situation can be avoided by this system where the user consumes very less amount of time when compared to the reading from manual paper through the digital system. The aims and objectives of the system to be produced have been stated below:
•	To build a system that would enable users to read and write stories.
•	Create a secure authentication facility to check, validate users logging into the sail story system.
•	Create a database to be used to stored stories, and user information on the system.
•	View stories in AR/VR.
•	Study and implement a security method to be used to ensure that thoughts being stored in the system will not be compromised and any outside attack.
•	Enable the system to arrange the stories in category order. 
•	Create a backend administration section which will be used to enable the administration manage the system effectively.
•	Create tools for the administrator to add, delete and update details of users, and sub administrators on the system.
•	Obtain support through a char-bot.
