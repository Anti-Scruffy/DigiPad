                                        <h3>Secret Agents : My Bodyguard</h3>
										 <p>"I won't repeat again," he spits on my face. "Where are those traitors?" 

It takes me a moment before I can open my mouth. I almost can't feel it. 

That coward didn't go easy on me. 

Plus, fear freezes me. I don't know who he is talking about.

"W-who are you t-talking about?"

I hate how weak, scared I sound and probably look. I can tell the man smiles in the dark. He digs his fingers into my skin. I'm sure I'll have bruises on my arms tomorrow, and obviously on my face.

If he doesn't kill me before. 

As if he reads my mind, he leans towards me. "Listen barbie, we can do it the easy way. You answer my question and I leave. Or I use the other way a little bit more... hurtful." 

~

My parents are secret agents from a secret organization that I've never heard about. 
That's a lot of secrets about a lot of things... 
They said it's for my protection. 
But one day, their secret is revealed. 

I'm in danger. My brother's in danger. 

That's the moment when my amazing parents decide to hire a bodyguard. A bodyguard! 
Mysterious, arrogant, serious, and for God's sake... pretty handsome. 

Nothing could go wrong, right? <br>To read more click on the text...https://www.wattpad.com/story/109889518-secret-agents-my-bodyguard</p>

												<h3>Wingless</h3> 
                                        <p>-Wing-

I saved you when you were in danger and you stabbed me in the back. 
Every action has an equal and opposite reaction, it's the laws of the universe and that of Karma. 
Now here we are again, brought together by cruel circumstances once more.
I need your help but you're my enemy and I don't trust you.
You think you own me.
But guess what?
I won't help you. Not now, not ever.
I know who you are, Arke Nikovich, and I'm not afraid of you.


-Arke-

You think you know me?
You think you can win by watching me lose. 
I'll never lose when it's you.
If you really did know me you wouldn't come after me.
But I know you need my help, desperately. And I'll need something in return, my sweet.
I'm dangerous.
I'm your worst nightmare but you don't know it just yet.
You shouldn't come to me but I know you will, and I'll be waiting.
Time's ticking, little Wing, and you better pick a side because I'm coming back for my crown and my city.

												<h3>The Fifth Element </h3> 
                                        <p>In Elemental magic you can be one of four magic types; water, fire, earth, and air. The only problem is Violet is none of these things. Is she what they call a magic dud, or is she something rarer, more powerful, and more dangerous than anyone could have imagined!?
        
        Teasers,
        "Em, most girls sneak out for a boy, you sneak out for a unicorn."
        
        I began to cry as it reached for my face."No!" I screamed. "Please No!"
        
        I went to pull back the shower curtain, but some nagging thought in the back of my head stopped me. I didn't have a little brother, so why was there a little boy in my bathroom? I gulped and with shaking hands pulled back the shower curtain.
        
        "You tried to commit suicide!" I said in horror.
        
        "What!? How could that be!?" I yelled, and covered my hand with my mouth. Shouting wasn't such a good idea right at this moment.  If someone heard us and came up here to investigate the noise we were making, they would find a boy and a girl, a bloody knife with both their finger prints on it, and a very very dead body.
        
        "Don't touch her!" he hissed and lunged at Henry.
        
        Running through the night wearing nothing but a flimsy hospital dress, while waving a dismembered hand in his hand, was a strangeness no regular person could hope to inspire to.To read more click on the text...https://www.wattpad.com/story/6614803-the-fifth-element </p>

												<h3>The Lost Valor of Love </h3> 
                                        <p>Growing up during the centuries-long conflict between the empires of Egypt and Hatti, the young princess Istara is taken hostage by the King of Hatti to secure the loyalty of her father, the King of Kadesh to the empire. Soon her new life in Hatti's glittering capital becomes all she knows. Bound in blood before the gods to Hatti's unwilling crown prince, Istara, now Hatti's queen-in-waiting, learns she will never be loved.
          
But the drums of war beat again, and when the scheming plans of Hatti's king threaten the existence of all civilization, the gods give Istara a choice: to leave behind everything she knows to save mankind, or remain where she is, powerless, a token on the game board of kings. On the brink of one of the most brutal battles in history, she chooses to risk her life to deliver a message to the only man able to prevent the prophecy from becoming a reality--her mortal enemy, the Pharaoh Ramesses II.
          
Wounded, cold and hungry, she wanders in the battle's horrific aftermath, and aids a powerful commander, who she learns protected her once, and has been bound to her ever since by a prophetic dream of his future. Despite his resistance, and Istara once more becoming a pawn of kings, they must confront an eternal love so powerful, not even kings, the gods, or death can keep them apart.To read more click on the text...https://www.wattpad.com/story/92371577-the-lost-valor-of-love</p>

                                         <p>Feminism has too often been confused with man-hating 
Feminism is the belief that men and women should have equal right

For Emily, every day of the last two years has been a blur. She keeps her head down, taking her college courses online and only going out to work at her mandatory internship. That all changes the day the office elevator breaks down, leaving her trapped when the screams begin. 
 
When the doors finally open, Emily is launched into a terrifying run for her life. Now, Emily must face her inner demons if she is to have any hope of surviving the monsters outside.To read more click on the text...https://www.wattpad.com/story/89990411-finding-humanity </p>

												<h3>A Different Virus - Heartfire </h3>
                                         <p>People who were bitten by zombies always turned into zombies. Or that was what everyone always said. To get bitten was basically a death sentence. Seizures marked the moment of turning before the infected person rose with bright red eyes and tried to attack any living thing near them. 

Diane and her friends take shelter in a military base while civilization collapses. They and the other survivors must learn to survive with zombies outside. The zombies may be slow, but they were tireless and far too ready to take a bite out of anyone they could get their hands on.

Diane holds onto a small hope that humanity will survive and eventually rebuild even though the known human world has vanished like mist and most of the population is now mindless zombies. She certainly isn't about to go down without putting her best effort into this fight for survival.

The unknown has a habit of sneaking up on you when you least suspect it.

One thing is certain though, life will never be the same again.

Sneak peek

I looked up and stared. My reflection looked back at me in the mirror of the dark room. My eyes were literally glowing, there was no mistaking it. It was not a reflection of light, or any of the other excuses I had used or others had assumed. They were glowing a light sapphire blue color. It was not a bright glow, but it was definitely a glow.

Glowing eyes were not normal.
Okay, at this point I had to admit it, I was no longer normal.
What was I then? For that, I had no answer.To read more click on the text...https://www.wattpad.com/story/82040526-a-different-virus-heartfire </p>

"N-no, I'll do it." I whisper. 

"Then prove it." he states with a smirk, "Prove to me that you're willing to do this." 

"How?" I ask in a barely audible whisper, my entire body starting to shake in fear or excitement, I can't tell which. 

"Kiss me, like you mean it." he whispers back at me, looking down at my lips with hunger.

Anne De Ville is as normal as a teenage girl with three brothers and divorced parents gets. She has no dogs because she is too lazy to take them for walks and spends her life reading or studying. 

On an average sunny day,  Anne decides she needs to buy new shoes and so she goes to the closest mall and buys new converses. Little did she know that she might accidentally drop her shoes down three flights of stairs and they might accidentally fall on Hunter Denegan's head. 

Hunter Denegan. The baddest of the bad, the meanest of the mean, the best of the best and the sexiest of the sexy. He is the schools bad boy and people worship him at his feet. 

What happens when a pair of converses land on Hunter's head and he turns into prince charming, looking for the girl who lost her shoe? To read more click on the text...https://www.wattpad.com/story/67944280-it-started-with-a-converse

Mia White was just an ordinary girl that walked the face of earth. She was who people looked up to. She had good grades, was the kindest person you'd ever meet, and was breathtakingly beautiful. Everyone in ClearHills Academy loved her. But, there were also some who feared and despised her.

Some people hated Mia because she was known as 'little miss perfect' and because she was claimed by the one who practically owned everything. Besides her best friend, Sarah, not many people approached her.

Most people feared that if they were to do something wrong, it would anger him. And that was the last thing people wanted.

Ace King was someone not to mess with. His father owns a powerful company that he would soon take over. He was what parents told their kids not become. He was the bad boy of ClearHills Academy.

Ever since Ace first laid eyes on her as kids, she was what he wanted most. Mia was the only person who he'd drop on his knees and bow down to, she was the only person he cared not to be feared by.

She was the only who could tame him.

"What is it dear? Do you want something else?" his mother asked, looking down to see his attention focused on something.

Or rather, someone.

"Her," he said, pointing at a girl, sitting on a small wooden stool with a book in her hands. "I want her."

												<h3>Her Innocent Heart</h3>
                                        <p>"Let go off me!" She yelled while wriggling in his steel grip on her arm.

"Quiet!" He was dragging her into the somewhat deserted building and shoved her into the lift ruthlessly.

"W-where are you taking me?" Her voice cracked with tears, when she saw him stabbing the no. 9.

"To hell." He gnashed cruelly.

The only sound that echoed throughout the corridor were her cries, as he dragged her outside of lift.

He swiped a card in door mechanism. The black deadening aura welcomed her, when door got opened after a beep. He ferociously pulled in- then shoved her in a room to the left. She stumbled inside, due to darkness and lehnga (toe length embellished skirt) and fall onto the floor. He simply strode in and punched the light switches on.

The fear tormented her...when he kicked the door shut and locked it. Her heart dropped into stomach and breaths gone shorter, as he moved towards her, slowly and calculatingly, with a clenched jaw.

"No....don't do this", She was backing away with his every  step took in her direction.

Slap!

He whipped her face so hard to fell on bed and then tumbling to floor.

"Bitch, you think you could get away with trying to fool me? He yanked her roughly back to himself.

"I haven't done anything, let me go." 

She started blowing baby fists into his barrel chest 

"Bitch! you're just like your bastard of a brother" His harsh tug and jerk on her veil, did her unveiled completely. 

She sobbed hard shielding herself through arms; her breath then hitched.

He was unbuckling his belt, with a predatory gleam in his ebony Irises. 

"No..please...don't do this...to me. Don't you fear God?" She was backing away with trembling form.

Slapping the belt against ground, coming towards her, with his thuds heavy. He was in Beast Mode.To read more click on the text...https://www.wattpad.com/story/67338744-her-innocent-heart-masoom-dil</p>

												<h3>The Father</h3> 
                                        <p>THE man whose story is here to be told was the wealthiest and most influential person in his parish; his name was Thord Overaas. He appeared in the priest's study one day, tall and earnest. "I have gotten a son," said he, "and I wish to present him for baptism."

"What shall his name be?"

"Finn,—after my father."

"And the sponsors?"

They were mentioned, and proved to be the best men and women of Thord's relations in the parish.

"Is there anything else?" inquired the priest, and looked up.

The peasant hesitated a little.

"That is because I have no troubles," replied Thord.

To this the priest said nothing, but after a while he asked: "What is your pleasure this evening?"

"I have come this evening about that son of mine who is to be confirmed to-morrow."

"He is a bright boy."

"I did not wish to pay the priest until I heard what number the boy would have when he takes his place in church to-morrow."

"He will stand number one.'

"So I have heard; and here are ten dollars for the priest."

"Is there anything else I can do for you?" inquired the priest, fixing his eyes on Thord.

"There is nothing else."

Thord went out.To read more click on the text...https://americanliterature.com/author/bjrnstjerne-bjrnson/short-story/the-father</p>
